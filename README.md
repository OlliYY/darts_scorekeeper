## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OlliYY/darts_scorekeeper.git
cd darts_scorekeeper
```

### 2. Install Flutter and Dependencies

Make sure you have [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) installed.

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### 3. Configure Supabase

Create a file called `lib/supabase_config.dart` and add your own Supabase credentials:

```dart
const supabaseUrl = 'https://your-project.supabase.co';
const supabaseAnonKey = 'your-anon-key';
```

You also need a Supabase table called `players`:

| Column | Type    | Notes             |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| id     | UUID    | Primary key       |
| name   | Text    | Player name       |
| wins   | Integer | Default = 0       |

You can create the table manually in Supabase or use SQL:

```sql
create table players (
  id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
  name text,
  wins integer default 0
);
```

### 4. Run the App

Make sure an Android emulator is running or a device is connected:

```bash
flutter run
```
